# python
Here I collect some "Tips &amp; tricks for Python programming", i.e., 
nontrivial and helpful code snippets that I want to keep for my own reference 
(usually since it took me some time to figure them out) 
and maybe of interest to others.
Enjoy - and let me know if you have suggestions for improvements!
