# python
Here I collect some "Tips &amp; tricks for Python programming", i.e., 
nontrivial and helpful code snippets that I want to keep for my own reference 
(usually since it took me some time to figure out how to make something work) 
and maybe of interest to others.

Enjoy - and let me know if you have suggestions for improvements!

I decided to create subfolders for different categories:
* [language_basics](language_basics): for basic but also somewhat advanced Python-language specific stuff. (Examples: properties in classes, persistent data: json, pickle, shelves, sql, ...)
* [graphics](graphics): how-to creatie simple and advanced graphics (plot of vector fields..., ...) with Python
* [math](math): programs related to math: Number Theory, numerical analysis, ...
